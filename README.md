# BLIND SIGNATURE USING RSA For Secured Voting System

## Introduction

### Blind Signature

Blind signature schemes provide a better way of achieving the senderâ€™s privacy. These can be used to abide by certain rules like voting protocols, and digital money transaction policies. For example, in electronic voting systems first, the user needs to be verified that the voter is certified by an election authority to vote before it can be accepted for counting. In turn, this allows the authority to check the credentials of the voter to ensure that they are allowed to vote. Simultaneously, it is important that this authority does not learn the voter's selections. An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting.
